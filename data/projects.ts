          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 font-main">üéØ Business Problem</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 font-main leading-relaxed">IBM Telco has a churn rate of <strong class="font-semibold">27%</strong>, which means a lot of customers are leaving.

The existing landing and checkout pages were underperforming, with user drop-off at the payment stage being a significant bottleneck.</p>
